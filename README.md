## Assignment Description ##

This project tasked us with using Handlebars templates to create a website in which the user could add burger names to a 'burgers' table in a SQL database, which would then be rendered in the browser. The user could then 'devour' the burgers by clicking a button next to eac one. The burgers status would be changed to 'devoured,' and the devoured burgers populate elsewhere on the webpage.

The aim of this assignment was to test our ability to use Object Relational Mapping to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD commands) items in a database and render them onto the webpage.

This assignment was very similar to a class assignment in which the user would create fictional cats, and use CRUD commands to display whether or not each cat was sleeping or awake.
